# XML-Based Tool Calling Implementation for OpenManus

This guide explains the changes made to implement XML-based tool calling in OpenManus.

## Overview of Changes

The core issue in the original implementation was that OpenManus was trying to use OpenAI's native tool calling format with OpenRouter, which was failing with a 404 error. The solution was to use the XML-based tool calling approach consistently throughout the codebase.

## Files Modified

1. `app/tool/browser_use_tool.py` - Updated to use `LLMIntegration` for XML-based tool calling
2. `app/tool/webdev/enhanced_website_analyzer.py` - Modified to handle the new response format
3. `app/parser/tool_parser.py` - Used to parse XML-formatted tool calls

## Implementation Details

### 1. BrowserUseTool Changes

The key changes in `browser_use_tool.py`:

- Added `LLMIntegration` instance along with the existing `LLM` instance
- Updated `_extract_content` method to use `ask_with_tools` instead of `ask_tool`
- Added XML parsing with `parse_assistant_message` to extract tool calls
- Implemented fallback options for when XML parsing fails

### 2. EnhancedWebsiteAnalyzer Changes

The key changes in `enhanced_website_analyzer.py`:

- Added import for `parse_assistant_message`
- Updated content extraction methods to handle both JSON and XML formats
- Improved error handling for different response formats

### 3. Testing

Created test scripts:

- `scripts/test_xml_tool_calling.py` - Tests the BrowserUseTool with XML tool calling
- `test_xml_implementation.py` - Tests the entire implementation

## How to Test

1. Run the XML tool calling test:
   ```
   python scripts/test_xml_tool_calling.py
   ```

2. Run the comprehensive implementation test:
   ```
   python test_xml_implementation.py
   ```

3. Test the full lead analyzer with the changes:
   ```
   python analyze_by_id.py 0067ee5c-f920-4982-8b5d-69fc32039624
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs for parsing errors
2. Verify that `LLMIntegration` is being used correctly
3. Make sure the system prompts include the XML tool calling instructions
4. Test with different models that are known to work well with XML formatting

## Future Improvements

Consider these long-term improvements:

1. Standardize all tools to use `LLMIntegration` instead of direct `LLM` calls
2. Add validation of responses against expected formats
3. Implement better fallback mechanisms when parsing fails
4. Create a central tool registry for better organization
5. Add more comprehensive logging for debugging
