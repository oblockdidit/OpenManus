# OpenRouter Streaming Response Fix

## Issue Overview

After fixing the browser URL and API key issues, we encountered another error:

```
Error in ask_with_tools: 'async for' requires an object with __aiter__ method, got ChatCompletion
```

This error occurred because the code was trying to use `async for` to iterate over a `ChatCompletion` object, which doesn't support asynchronous iteration. This happens because the OpenRouter API sometimes returns different response types depending on the model and request parameters.

### Root Cause

The issue was in the `llm_integration.py` file where it attempted to handle the response from OpenRouter. The code assumed that the response would always be an asynchronous iterable (for streaming responses), but in reality:

1. OpenRouter sometimes returns a complete `ChatCompletion` object instead of a stream, even when `stream=True` is specified
2. Different models may have different streaming behaviors
3. The OpenAI client library behavior may change with updates

### Solution

We implemented a robust solution that can handle both streaming and non-streaming responses:

1. **Try-Except Pattern**: Added a try-except block around the `async for` loop to catch cases where the response doesn't support asynchronous iteration

2. **Type Detection**: Added logic to detect if the response is already a complete `ChatCompletion` object rather than a stream

3. **Fallback Handling**: When a non-stream is detected, we extract the content directly from the response object

4. **Better Logging**: Added logging to track the types of responses received from the OpenRouter API

## Code Changes

1. Updated the streaming response handling in `ask_with_tools`:

```python
# Handle streaming or non-streaming response
if stream:
    # Streaming expected to return an async iterator
    collected_chunks = []
    try:
        async for chunk in response_stream:
            content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
            if content:
                collected_chunks.append(content)
    except (TypeError, AttributeError) as e:
        # Handle non-streaming response that was sent with stream=True
        logger.warning(f"Response doesn't support async iteration: {e}. Falling back to non-streaming handling.")
        if hasattr(response_stream, 'choices') and response_stream.choices:
            # Handle as a regular completion
            content = response_stream.choices[0].message.content
            if content:
                collected_chunks.append(content)
```

2. Similar updates for non-streaming response handling:

```python
# Non-streaming response
collected_chunks = []

# Check if response_stream is already a complete response (not an async iterator)
if hasattr(response_stream, 'choices') and response_stream.choices:
    # It's already a complete ChatCompletion object
    content = response_stream.choices[0].message.content
    if content:
        collected_chunks.append(content)
else:
    # Try to iterate (legacy support)
    try:
        async for chunk in response_stream:
            content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
            if content:
                collected_chunks.append(content)
    except (TypeError, AttributeError) as e:
        logger.warning(f"Unexpected response format: {e}")
```

3. Enhanced logging in the OpenRouter provider:

```python
response = await client.generate_completion(
    messages=messages,
    model_id=full_model_id,
    temperature=temperature,
    max_tokens=max_tokens,
    stream=actual_stream,
    top_p=top_p
)

logger.info(f"OpenRouter returned response type: {type(response).__name__}")
```

## Testing

These changes should be tested with various models available through OpenRouter, as different models may have different streaming behaviors. The solution now handles both streaming and non-streaming responses gracefully, regardless of the actual response type returned by the API.

## Future Improvements

For a more robust solution in the future, consider:

1. **Response Type Abstraction**: Create a common response interface that normalizes different response types

2. **Model-Specific Settings**: Configure streaming behavior based on known model characteristics

3. **Streaming Reliability Test**: Add a pre-check to test if a model supports reliable streaming before using stream mode

## Additional Notes

This fix addresses the immediate issue with response handling, but the OpenRouter API behavior may continue to evolve. The current implementation should be resilient to common variations in the API behavior.
